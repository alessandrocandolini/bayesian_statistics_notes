\myChapter{visualization tools}

Visualizing data and the results is of major importance to capture quickly the
key trends in the data.
We discuss a few of tools which can be useful to plot data:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Mathplotlib in Python
   \item Asymptote for latex integration
   \item MathGL
   \item VTK
\end{itemize}

There are other tools of course (eg, gnuplot).
Our choice is due mainly to the following reasons: Mathplotlib runs in Python,
and offers a variety of drawing tools, making it suitable for developinging
quickly nice output plots. 
Asymptote offers a great integration with LaTeX files. It is written in C++.
MathGL is a \cpp{} library.
VTK is VTK.
