HDF is an acronym for Hierarchical Data Format.
HDF5 data format Version 5 is a general purpose, portable, truly hierarchical,
filesystem-like data file format used for storage, management
and exchange of extremely large and complex collection of numerical data.
It was originally developed by the US National Center for Supercomputing Applications
(NCSA) and it is currently supported by the HDF Group%
\footnote{\label{footnote:HDF5}See the HDF Group official website at \url{http://www.hdfgroup.org/}.}.
HDF is supported by many commercial and non-commercial software platforms.

In this chapter, we will discuss some basic code sample to handle HDF5 file
format in \cpp{}.
Most of the content of this chapter is adapted from the HDF website quoted in
\cref{footnote:HDF5}.
